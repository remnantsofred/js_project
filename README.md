# Momo's Misadventures

## Background
Momo's Misadventures is a JavaScript game about a cat doing cat things. A player will cycle through a series of quick, silly and simple mini-games. 

The main screen will feature the title, score, and brief instructions on how to play. Each mini-game is only about 5 seconds long and will each contain their own set of rules. You must quickly figure out how to win each game on the fly.

In Momo's Misadventures, users will be able to:

- start, pause, and reset a game
- play a mini-game and earn a point for each mini-game successfully completed
