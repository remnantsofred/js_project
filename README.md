# Momo's Misadventures

## Background
Momo's Misadventures is a JavaScript game about a cat doing cat things. A player will cycle through a series of quick, silly and simple mini-games. 

The main screen will feature the title, score, and brief instructions on how to play. Each mini-game is only about 5 seconds long and will each contain their own set of rules. You must quickly figure out how to win each game on the fly. 


## Functionality & MVPs

In Momo's Misadventures, users will be able to:

- start, pause, and reset a game
- play a mini-game and earn a point for each mini-game successfully completed
- use the mouse and use a click for an action
- the gameplay for each mini-game will be different and a surprise!
- some levels include: 
    - catch the fly!
    - ambush your friend!
    - climb the cat tree!

In addition, this project will include: 
- an About modal describing the background and rules of the game
- a production README
