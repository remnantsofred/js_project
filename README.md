# Momo's Misadventures

[Momo's Misadventures live link](https://remnantsofred.github.io/momos_misadventures/)

## Background
Momo's Misadventures is a JavaScript game about a cat doing cat things. A player will cycle through a series of quick, silly and simple mini-games. 

The main screen will feature the title, score, and brief instructions on how to play. Each mini-game is only about 5 seconds long and will each contain their own set of rules. You must quickly figure out how to win each game on the fly. 


## Functionality & MVPs

In Momo's Misadventures, users will be able to:

- start, pause, and reset a game
- play a mini-game and earn a point for each mini-game successfully completed
- use the mouse and use a click for an action
- the gameplay for each mini-game will be different and a surprise!
- some levels include: 
    - catch the fly!
    - ambush your friend!
    - climb the cat tree!

In addition, this project will include: 
- an About modal describing the background and rules of the game
- a production README

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- The `Canvas API` to render the game screen and the mini-games
- `Webpack` to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
- `npm` to manage project dependencies


## To-dos 
- Fix the pause -> speeding up levels bug
- Implement a high score & show it
- About page


## Future features
- CSS styling and buttons and text layered over the canvas instead of filltext inside the canvas
- A mouseover/hover/drawer effect that shows the real Momo slide out
- Music & sound effects (using my real cats)
- More flavorful transitions with images, sounds, animations
- Additional collision effects (KILL)
- Update/refine collision logic
- More levels! (don't want to spoil them but I have many ideas)
  - Okay fine maybe just the titles: 
    - WAKE
    - CRY
    - DESTROY
- A way to save your name and high score, and display a high scores table
