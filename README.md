## Background
Momo's Misadventures is a JavaScript game about a cat doing cat things. A player will cycle through a series of quick, silly and simple mini-games. 

The main screen will feature the title, score, and brief instructions on how to play. Each mini-game is only about 5 seconds long and will each contain their own set of rules. You must quickly figure out how to win each game on the fly.

In Momo's Misadventures, users will be able to:

- start, play, and retry a game
- play a mini-game and earn a point for each mini-game successfully completed

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project was implemented with the following technologies:

- The `Canvas API` to render the game screen and the mini-games
- `Webpack` to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
- `npm` to manage project dependencies


## To-dos 
- About modal


## Future features
- CSS styling and buttons and text layered over the canvas instead of filltext inside the canvas
- Music & sound effects (using my real cats)
- More flavorful transitions with images, sounds, animations
- Additional collision effects (KILL)
- Update/refine collision logic
- More levels! (don't want to spoil them but I have many ideas)
  - Okay fine maybe just the titles: 
    - WAKE
    - CRY
    - DESTROY
- A way to save your name and high score, and display a high scores table
